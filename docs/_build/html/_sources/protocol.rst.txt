Protocol
========

The best way to describe the protocol in detail is to work through an example case. Therefore,
we will use singly-hydrated glycine as our working example and determine the concentrations and
geometries of the most common singly-hydrated glycine clusters in the atmosphere.

Step 1. Genetic Algorithm-Based Configurational Sampling
--------------------------------------------------------
The goal here is to obtain a list of configurations, and their associated ``.xyz`` files. To
do this, we must first obtain the optimized geometries of the water molecule and the glycine
molecule.

Set up the required directories::

    $ mkdir -p GA QM QM/m08hx-sb QM/m08hx-mg3s QM/m08hx-mg3s/ultrafine

Step 2. Rough Quantum Mechanical Geometry Refinement
----------------------------------------------------

Step 3. Detailed Quantum Mechanical Geometry Refinement
-------------------------------------------------------

Step 4. Calculation of Thermodynamic Quantities
-----------------------------------------------
