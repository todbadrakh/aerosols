Prerequisites
=============

This protocol is built around a collection of Linux shell scripts which handle the 
setup and submission of the necessary computations. The protocol also requires a 
particular directory structure to ensure that the shell scripts find the files they 
need. The shell scripts call on OGOLEM to carry out the configurational sampling 
step. The resulting set of cluster geometries are then refined using Gaussian 16. 
Finally, an in-house version of the THERMO script from NIST is used to compute and 
print the final thermodynamic data.

Directory Structure
-------------------
This protocol requires a specific directory structure shown below as the output of
``tree``.
