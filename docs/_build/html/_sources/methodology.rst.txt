Methodology
===========

Our ultimate goal is to compute the Gibbs free energy change associated with the 
formation of gas-phase molecular clusters. This information can be used to calculate 
how much of a particular molecule ends up suspended in the atmosphere as aerosols. 
In order to calculate the energy of a cluster, we need to know its geometry. The 
process of identifying the stable geometries of a cluster is called configurational 
sampling and is the first step of our methodology. We will use a genetic 
algorithm-based configurational sampling (GA) method. The set of cluster geometries 
identified through the GA method will then be refined through a series of screening 
calculations, resulting in a final set of low-energy clusters which represent the 
possible shapes/geometries of the given molecular clusters that we can expect our 
cluster to naturally be in. Finally, the thermodynamic properties of this set of 
possible clusters are calculated at a high level of accuracy to produce meaningful 
data.
