High-Level Electronic Energies
==============================

The electronic energies used in calculating the Gibbs free energies of formation of gas
phase molecular clusters can be computed at much higher levels of theory compared to
density-functional theory. In particular, explicitly-correlated, correlation-corrected
wavefunction-based methods such as CCSD(T)-F12 can be employed. These methods are
computationally very costly and scale poorly with system size due to the many mathematical
operations involved in solving the Schrodinger equation.
